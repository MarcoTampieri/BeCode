# BLog BeCode: Wanna be an official writer on the blog?

You want to share tuto, write small stories about what happen inside BeCode, publish some awesome stuff you prepared for your watch or workshop?    
The easiest way is to use Medium. The better way is to publish it on the BeCode's blog.

Once you wrote something you think could be published on the blog, contact Emily (by Ryver or by email) and send her your draft. She will review it. If your post is OK, she will promote you as an official writer on the blog and you will be able to publish your future post by yourself.

When you are a writer, you can link your post to the BeCode blog (a blog is called a "publication" on Medium):
- click on [...],
- then on [Add to publication],
- then check on [Becode],
- and finally click on [Add draft].
