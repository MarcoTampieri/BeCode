# my.becode.org INFORMATION

Hi folks!
We are proud to announce that you can now have access to the **event section** inside my.becode.org.    
What's its purpose?    
To indicate that you participate to events during your path.    
Did you go to a hackathon? A code initiation? A workshop? A conference?

Did you animate a watch? Nice! When? What was it about?    
Did you animate a workshop? Great! When? What was it about?

Why do we ask you that? External Organism (like FOREM, VDAB, Bruxelles Formation) need those informations with details.    
Why do we need these information even if you're not register to one of those organism? Because your data will be use in a anonymous way to show investors that they pay you the training for a good reason.

For example: "**Meaningful Code by Yann Lemin**" was a **conference** animated **23rd august**.

About "**workshop**" and "**workshop animation**": 
- if you participate to a workshop => **workshop**. 
- if YOU animate the workshop => **workshop animation**
