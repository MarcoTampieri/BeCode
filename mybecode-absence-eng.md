## Process
### Absence not planned with proof
Example : sickness
- go to « Absence planner » 
- check « Long-term absence »
- explain the reason of your absence

ℹ️ It is possible to **upload your proof later** but do it as soon as possible or it will be considered injustified.
Go to « Absence notifier », retrouve l'absence à justifier, envoie le document qu'il manquait.

**Any absence must be notified via the form or it will be considered as an unjustified absence.**

### Delay planned with proof
Exemple : rendez-vous administratif
- go to « Absence planner » 
- check « Early departure and late arrival »
- explain the reason of your early departure or your late arrival 

ℹ️ A delay or early departure without proof is equivalent to half a day of unjustified absence. It is possible to upload a photo (or PDF) of your proof afterwards.

### Delay not planned but justifiable
Example : retard SNCB
- got to « Absence planner » 
- check « Early departure and late arrival »
- explain the reason
- send the proof of train delay that you will find on the SNCB website.

### Absence planned
- check « Long-term absence » and explain the reason why you're not there

ℹ️ It is strongly recommended to upload your proof as soon as possible to avoid any problem of unjustified absence.

### Absence for a BeCode event
- check « Early departure and late arrival for a BeCode event » or « Long-term absence from a BeCode event »
- tell us to what event you're going
- send us the picture/scan of the "attestation participation événement" document filled with the coach's signature.
