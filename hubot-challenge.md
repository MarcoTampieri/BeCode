## things it should do

Basically, autoreply to keywords with useful information. 

For example :

`late` -> reply with 
> Don't forget to send beforehand an email to your coaches and admin@becode.org to inform them that you will be absent / late.
`github`-> autoreply github.com/becodeorg .
Feel free to add more ideas, like :
`joke` -> fetches a joke from a joke web service
`kitten`-> fetches a kitten Gif from a kitten web service.
